# Paper Fusion Strategy of Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Correlating Optical Coordinates and AIS Data in Maritime Monitoring

- AISdata: Data transmitted by vessels synchronized with the video.

- Dataset: Dataset used for model training and validation.

- Video: Demonstration video of the complete visual monitoring system, considering the YOLOv11-VoVGSCSP-P2 model and the training model for large images.

The video illustrates the simulation of the system proposed in the letter “Fusion Strategy of Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Correlating Optical Coordinates and AIS Data in Maritime Monitoring”, which employs the YOLOv11-VoVGSCSP-P2 model for accurate detection of small vessels in optical imagery. In each frame, ships are identified and their positions displayed in real time, along with the total object count. The interface simulates an automated maritime surveillance environment, including zoom-ins on selected vessels where a secondary model is applied to high-resolution imagery for improved robustness. Additionally, the system integrates a coordinate transformation strategy for mapping detections to sea-plane projections and supports the detection of AIS spoofing and going dark activities.
