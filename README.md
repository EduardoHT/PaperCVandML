Paper: Fusion Strategy of Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Correlating Optical Coordinates and AIS Data in Maritime Monitoring

- AISdata: Data transmitted by vessels synchronized with the video.

- Dataset: Dataset used for model training and validation.

- Video: Demonstration video of the complete visual monitoring system, considering the YOLOv11-VoVGSCSP-P2 model and the training model for large images.
